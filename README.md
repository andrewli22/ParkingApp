# ParkCount

ParkCount is an app that displays real-time data on parking availability across all Commuter Carparks (Park & Ride) across NSW.

This personal project was built to learn React Native and explore mobile app development. It also aims to solve a personal frustration of not knowing carpark availability in advance, so I could plan my commute and catch my trains on time.

## Tech Stack
